# FAQ

## How to use Autoplaylists ?

Autoplaylists are one of the biggest Watora's features. Many people don't understand how to use them. That's why I made a whole page about them. You can check out [how to use autoplaylists here.](features/autoplaylists.md)

## How to create my own Commands and Aliases ?

You have to use CustomCommands. You can do a lot of things with CustomCommands, including creating your own commands and aliases. I made a whole page about CustomCommands, [you can find it here](features/customcommands.md).
