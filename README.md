Welcome to **Watora's Documentation** !

I hope you'll find enough help to **fully understand** Watora. If you want to correct, edit, add or remove something on this Wiki, you can go on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/Zenrac/watora-doc). Your help will be gladly accepted ! 

## Setup the bot

Watora doesn't need any setup, it's designed to be intuitive.

But you can configure many things, take a look the the [settings page.](configuration/settings.md)

## Setup Autoplaylists

You can find a cool page to learn everything about Autoplaylists [here](features/autoplaylists.md).

## Create your own commands and aliases

If you want to create your own commands and your own aliases you'll have to use CustomCommands, maybe you should take a look to the[ CustomCommands page.](features/customcommands.md)
